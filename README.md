# Repository for UBC CPSC_V 203 PrairieLearn Tests

This repository contains code used in UBC's CPSC_V 203 course for a PrairieLearn-based practice test.  It almost certainly will not make sense without access to the corresponding test questions in PrairieLearn.

You can use this repository in one of two ways:
- You can clone it directly using the standard Git procedure.  In that case you **will not** be able to push your edits back up to this repository (you only have read access to this repository).
- You can copy this repository as a template in to your own GitHub account by following [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).  Using your own copy you can then push and pull as much as you like.  (We recommend that you make your own copy private so that other students won't confuse your repository with this one.)
